This is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) power converter hardware project. No code is required or included.

The pushbutton control circuitry is powered by the same input as the load.

A separate, logic-level input is provided (logic high enables VOUT; logic low disables VOUT).

It's been tested from 5-12VDC, and supports up to 15A with a fan.

Eagle .SCH and .BRD files are provided in ```eagle/```, along with images in ```images/```
