Kriner Power Converter
======================

This is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) power converter.

The pushbutton control circuitry is powered by the same input as the load.

A separate, logic-level input is provided (logic high enables VOUT; logic low disables VOUT).

It's been tested from 5-12VDC, and supports up to 15A with a fan.

Eagle .SCH and .BRD files are provided in /eagle, along with images in /images
